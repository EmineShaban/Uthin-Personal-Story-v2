        <p>
            Hi there, my name is Kerry Roger, I'm 36 years old and I am from London. A year ago, as I watched my two girlfriends smiling for the wedding photographer in their tight dresses, I wished I felt as confident аs them. <b>I almost burst out of my XL dress,</b>            and when I sat down, I felt my sleeves straining so badly, I thought it was going to tear open.

        </p>
        <p>
            <b>It had been such a struggle to find something to wear.</b> After ordering countless outfits online ( I felt ashamed to go to physical stores) and sending them all back, I’d end up settling on the best of a bad bunch.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’d always been a bit bigger than the other girls - my classmates, university colleagues, and girlfriends.
            <b>After I got married and gave birth to my kid (I was 31 back then), things just got worse.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Till my kid turned 3 years old, I ate leftover cakes every single day, and ordered pizza takeaways for dinner. I felt frustrated - <b>I wanted to slim down but I felt powerless when it comes to food.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            At first, I turned to meal-replacement shakes and cut out carbs. Within 2 weeks I’d lost 8 kg, but I was so hungry I couldn’t concentrate enough to deal with my tasks at work. So I stopped... <b>and quickly not only
                regained all the weight I’d lost but the scale was going up like crazy.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b> I wasn't the only one who found my jelly-like belly repulsive.
            </b> </p>
        <p>
            <b> My husband began to avoid sex with me.</b> The friends who hadn't seen me in a while remarked with concern how much I had changed…
        </p>
        <p>
            Feeling fed up with being rejected by my husband - I decided to make a change. My experience with diets had convinced me that <b>it was all about starving yourself,</b> which I didn’t want to do, so I purchased a gym card.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I entered the gym, I felt so anxious that everyone was staring at me, as if judging me for being “so big” that I just ran out of the building like I was escaping from a nightmare.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was feeling pretty frustrated… and when I stood on the scale at home, I saw that <b>I was about to “hit”
                90 kilos</b> - much more than I’d expected - tears began blurring my vision.
        </p>
        <h3 class="center">
            Starvation and gym attempts didn’t work… led to divorce.

        </h3>

        </div>
        <p>

            After my failure with diets and gym visits, my real drama started. I fought with my husband every day. In front of the kid. He started calling me hysteric pork and other derogatory names. As expected, the
            <b>relationship with my husband was getting toxic</b> for both of us. We got divorced…
        </p>
        <p>
            At that time <b>I was not only fat, but also dumped… in total despair.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b> How to lose weight in the easy way
            </b> </p>
        <p>
            Thank God, my depression and obesity didn’t last forever, all thanks to a chat with an old friend of mine - – Jeanne, my former classmate who, just like me, used to be the chubby girl in her early years and struggled to lose weight since a teenager. She
            comforted me about my failed attempt to train at the gym, telling me,
            <b>‘You didn’t miss anything. You can lose weight without sweating there, I myself managed to do it without
                stepping foot inside the gym.’</b> To prove me she was right, she sent me pictures of herself. I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES.
        </p>
        <p>

            <b>She had melted off!!!</b> She had <b>lost 15 kilos in just 2 weeks,</b> thanks to taking a product containing thousands of natural ingredients <b>that speed up the metabolism.</b> Impatiently, I typed: TELL ME THE NAME OF IT! She sent me
            a link to <b>the official page of the product - <a class="uthin" href="">Uthin Triple Slim.</a></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            It turned out that this thing is <b>THE ONLY EASY weight-loss method</b> that gives results without counting calories like a mathematician or sweating to death in front of the whole neighborhood like an idiot at the gym.
